# Margin Perceptron
This project implements the margin perceptron algorithm.
## Background
Given radius as the original gamma guess to obtain a guaranteed linear classifier when the gamma guess is suitable.
Ortherwise, update the gamme guess by halving the previous gamma guess until the gamma guess <= real gamma
